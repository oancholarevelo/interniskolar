# InternIskolar - PUP OJT Portal

A web portal for Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) students to find internship opportunities and track their applications. Administrators can manage partner companies and their MOA agreements.

## What is InternIskolar?

InternIskolar is a centralized platform where PUP students can browse available internship opportunities at partner companies (Host Training Establishments or HTEs) and track their application progress.
